##Exploit for the ti service from GITS-2014

Application is a stack based calculator for double precision floating point numbers. 
Example Usage:
 1
 2
 +
 .
>3

The application can be coerced into negativly indexing its floating point stack.
By negativly indexing into the GOT we can overwrite the entry for exit.
To exploit the service we write shellcode as a series of floating point numbers
then overwrite the GOT entry for exit to point to the shellcode.
In order to use socket reuse shellcode we wait for the signal handler to call
exit, using the 'q' command will close the socket forcing the use of connect
back shellcode.

To run the exploit:
in one window:
./strace.sh
in another window:
python exploit.py

In order to run the service you must have a user named gambino
