Overview:
* Page that lets you upload a zip and cats all of files in the zip

Attack:
* Pretty obvious the attack is zip symlinks
* Symlinked a file to /var/www/html/index.php to dump page code
* Noticed flag path had to be read with sudo so couldn't just symlink to it
* Found a race condition
** cat all files
** rm -rf /{upload_dir}/
** If we can keep the cat running, we can upload a PHP shell and run commands from it
* Symlinked /dev/zero to a file
* Zipped that symlink and a php shell
* Uploaded and went to tmp path given
* sudo cat {flag_path}
