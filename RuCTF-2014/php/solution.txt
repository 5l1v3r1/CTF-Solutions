Web 100: php
The vulnerability was a local file inclusion via the Accept-Language header.
The web page attemped to detect your language automatically (using the header)
and would give you a translated copy of the wikipedia article on CTFs. There
were no errors, only "successfully detected language" or "could not detect
language." My final payload to grab the source code of the challenge was as
follows:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: w1.quals.ructf.org
Accept-Language: ,php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/usr/share/nginx/www/index.php,
