Forensics 100: Secret Host
You're given a memory dump and two files: a certificate and an openvpn
configuration. I set up tunnelblick to use the certificate and config file to
connect to the VPN, but was greeted with a password. I inspected the memory
dump (read: I used strings) and found the credentials. I authenticated, visited
http://10.0.0.100/, viewed the source, and got the flag.
