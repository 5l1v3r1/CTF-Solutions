### Problem

One of the NullCon vidoes talked about a marvalous Russian Gift. The Vidoe was uploaded on [May of 2015] What is the ID of that youtube video.

### Solution

nullcon has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/nullcon). Going through all ~6 videos published in May 2015, I submitted all of the IDs until one of the IDs was [correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_PvN_A1ts).

Key: `a4_PvN_A1ts`
