This exploit leverages an uncontrolled format string vulnerability to create
a read anything anywhere and a write anything anywhere condition. The 
exploit leverages these conditions to leak a stack address and write a ROP
chain to unused stack memory. The exploit then corrupts a saved base pointer
on the stack to ensure the execution of the ROP payload eventually spawning
a shell.
