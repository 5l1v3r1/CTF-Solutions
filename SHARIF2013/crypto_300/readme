In this problem you need to find the value of x that satisfies the equation.

The key to solving this problem is realizing that the difference between the
values of the right hand side of the equation for x and x+1 are consitantly
different by a value of 11111111111111111111111. This makes finding x as simple
as dividing 918200861937462866666657484658047292039 by 
11111111111111111111111 for a value of 82638077574371658 and submitting the md5
sum(413e07f82db619cd34f8152fae2c3431) for the points. No hard math needed :)
