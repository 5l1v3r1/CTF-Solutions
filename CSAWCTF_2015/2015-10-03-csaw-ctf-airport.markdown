Unzipping the airport file, there are two folders. `__MACOSX` is automatically generated by OSX and it is irrelevant to the challenge. steghide.jpg is compatible with the steghide tool. Identifying the four airports as:
```
1st: Jose Marti, Cuba
2nd: HongKong, China
3rd: LAX, USA
4th: Toranto Pearson, Canada
```
The third was difficult to guess because it was in Korean, but there were not many airports in Korea to guess from. However, the blog was speaking of the LAX airport.
The fourth was difficult to guess because a reverse image search could not find a result, unlike the other three. Using the highway numbers listed, the airport was found on Google Maps.
Enter in the airport codes in consecutive order.
`steghide extract -p "HAVHKGLAXYYZ" -sf steghide.jpg`

A flag.txt is extracted.

FLAG: `iH4t3A1rp0rt5`
